# queue-with-linked-list

Implementation of a Queue using a Doubly Linked List

20 functions for the class were implemented to interact with the queue, examples include:

- Enqueue (function for adding elements at the tail (end) of the queue)
- Dequeue (function for removing elements at the head (start) of the queue and returning them)
- Reverse (function for reversing the order of the queue)
- Copy (function for returning a copy of the function-calling queue)
- Merge (function for merging the contents of another queue into the function-calling queue)

Files included in the repository:
- main.cpp (main file where queue functions are tested)
- Queue.h (header file containing the class declaration of Queue)
- Queue.cpp (implementation file containing member function definitions)
